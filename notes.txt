The documentation for this use case is not good at all, and took me a while to figure it out, but if you want to distribute your app for testing with Expo Go, you can simply use eas update, for example: eas update --branch preview --message 'my new version'

This command will build the JS bundle locally and it will host it at Expo's servers. You can find the link / QR code under "Updates" by logging into https://expo.dev with your Expo account.

It's not required to use eas build before eas update.
